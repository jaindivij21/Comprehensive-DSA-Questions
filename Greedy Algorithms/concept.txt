Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most 
obvious and immediate benefit. 

Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the
following property: 
        At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem. 

If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms 
are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. 
For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.

Following are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms. 
Activity Selection Problem.
Graph Coloring Problem.
Job Sequencing Problem with Deadlines.
Find minimum platforms needed to avoid delay in the train arrival.
Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm.
Single-Source Shortest Paths — Dijkstra's Algorithm.
